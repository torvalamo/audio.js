# Don't use this

There are better and more updated libraries out there. The spec has changed since this was made, and also a new Web Audio API has been introduced, making HTML5 Audio more professional.

This library isn't finished either. I keep it around for occasional reference. and for posterity.

I suggest you look at [Buzz](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/) first. **WARNING: Slightly loud sound on page load.**

## How to use

Add either `simpleaudio.js` or `audio.js` to your document's `<head>` tag:

	<script src="simpleaudio.js"></script>

For a complete overview of the differences between the two, as well as a
function reference, see the [wiki](http://github.com/torvalamo/htmlaudio/wiki/)

## Notes

- A [road map](http://github.com/torvalamo/htmlaudio/wiki/Road-Map) is
available in the wiki.
- The interface may change drastically and/or without backwards compatibility
up until version 0.5 (when the interface gets locked).
- There is no changelog until version 0.5+ for the above mentioned reason. If
you want to see what has changed you need to look at the diffs between commits.
The wiki function references will also contain some information.
- Example sound effects are borrowed from [hamsterrepublic](http://hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/index.php/Free_Sound_Effects.html)
