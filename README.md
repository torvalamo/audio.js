## Use

Add either `simpleaudio.js` or `audio.js` to your document's `<head>` tag:

	<script src="simpleaudio.js"></script>

For a complete overview of the differences between the two, as well as a
function reference, see the [wiki](http://github.com/torvalamo/htmlaudio/wiki/)

## Notes

- The interface may change drastically and/or without backwards compatibility
up until version 0.5 (when the interface gets locked).
- There is no changelog until version 0.5+ for the above mentioned reason. If
you want to see what has changed you need to look at the diffs between commits.
The wiki function references will also contain some information.
